# REMIX Day 2 - Build Your Own GPT in Circuits

Today, you'll learn more features of the Circuits library and use them to write a GPT-style transformer from scratch. By the end, you'll be able to load pretrained weights and do inference on GPT-2.

<!-- toc -->

## Learning Objectives

After today's material, you should be able to:

- Explain all the individual operations in a transformer and how they combine
- Explain how batch dimensions are handled in Circuits
- Write your own `Module`s as necessary

## Readings

- [Language Modelling with Transformers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJQT8PJYzvL0CLacctWcT0T5NfL7dwlCiIqRtdTcIqA/edit#) - note that we're going to completely ignore dropout, since it isn't used at inference time.

## The Symbol class

In Day 1, our `Circuit` had specific sizes like 28*28 "baked in", and it would've been a pain to reuse the same `Circuit` for a situation where the structure of the network was the same, but the sizes of some things were different.

It would be nice if we had a `Circuit` that represents the network architecture in the abstract. This `Circuit` wouldn't reference any weight `Array`s, and wouldn't reference specific sizes like the hidden size that can vary between models using this architecture. We could write this abstract thing once and then "substitute in" weights to obtain a `Circuit` representing a specific model we can evaluate.

While we're at it, it would be nice to solve the problem of batching. In Day 1, we manually modified our `Circuit` to have batching support. While most things "just work" with a batch dimension prepended to the front (thanks to broadcasting rules), some things didn't work without modification like our `Einsum` string.

Both difficulties are addressed with a new subclass of `Circuit` called `Symbol`. It has a name and a shape, but no data. Trying to evaluate a `Symbol` will throw an exception. `Symbol` is just a placeholder that needs to be replaced with something else before evaluation happens. It's safer than an `Array` as a placeholder - if we forgot to replace an `Array`, then we would still be able to call `evaluate` using the wrong data.

### UUIDs

A `Symbol` also has a UUID. If you've never heard of a UUID, all you need to know is that that they are random numbers big enough that when you generate one, it's almost certainly true that no other Circuits user has ever generated the same one. Refer to the [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html) if you want to know more.

The point of the UUID is to distinguish between two `Symbols` with identical names and shapes. Equality on `Symbol` requires that the UUID is equal.

<details>

<summary>Can't we just use the memory address of the Symbol object for uniqueness?</summary>

We're going to be saving Circuits to disk, and they can't be guaranteed to be in the same memory location after reloading the Circuit. The UUID can be saved with the Symbol and thus stay the same between sessions.

</details>

### Symbolic Sizes

To solve the issue with specific sizes being hardcoded, one option is to just use a special value that a size can't have, like -1, so a single input to a transformer would have size (-1, -1) for the sequence and hidden dimensions, for example.

One issue is we lose out on some consistency checking in this way - it's no longer possible to check that the sequence dimension is consistent everywhere in the network, for example.

The galaxy brain solution is to have a bunch of pre-determined special values, where one represents "hidden dimension", one represents "sequence dimension" and so on. If we use them consistently throughout the architecture, we'll be able to enforce consistency. In the current implementation, these are just some primes that are larger than all integers that are used for actual sizes.

This particular implementation is pretty unsafe and subject to change. Its main benefit is that all the regular shape inference code you wrote in Day 1 supports this feature without any modifications (it doesn't care whether the integer represents a real size or a symbolic size).

## Useful Helper Functions

### reciprocal

We'll need to compute `1/x` for a `Circuit` `x` today. We could use operator overloading to make this syntax work, but then we'd have no way of giving the result a `name` field.

Instead, we have functions like `rc.reciprocal`, which evaluate to the same as `torch.reciprocal` but allow specifying the name. `rc.reciprocal` also has metadata describing algebraic properties of this function. For example, `(1/x)[i] == `1/(x[i])`.

### rsqrt

### last_dim_size

Finally, `rc.last_dim_size(x)` evaluates to `torch.full(x.shape[:-1], x.shape[-1])`.

This is kinda weird and subject to change, but the point of using this is that symbolic sizes work properly with it.

## LayerNorm in Circuits

A PyTorch implementation of LayerNorm is provided for reference. Additionally, in the `remix_images` folder there are some PDF schematics you can refer to. To view these, either copy them to your local machine or install the [vscode-pdf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomoki1207.pdf) extension.

Your implementation can be less general than the PyTorch version. In particular, you should assume:

- The parameter `elementwise_affine` is always `True`;
- The shapes of `input`, `weight`, and `bias` are all `(HIDDEN,)` (we'll get to batching later);
- Normalization is computed over the last (and only) dimension; and
- You don't need to worry about resetting the `weight` and `bias` as we'll only be using the Circuit for inference today.

This is sufficient for doing inference in transformers, and specializing in this way makes our job easier.

It's not important today to have an intuition about what LayerNorm is doing other than "it's surprisingly complicated". The article [Re-Examining LayerNorm](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jfG6vdJZCwTQmG7kb/re-examining-layernorm) is worth a read at some future time.

Exercise: Implement LayerNorm as a `Circuit`. The names of the internal nodes are up to you; it can be helpful to give unique names to things for debugging purposes but it's also fine to ignore the names.

In addition to `Einsum`, `Add`, and `Scalar` from before, use the below functions. You could write your own lambdas for these, but using these ones from the API ensures that your Circuit will be serializable (more on this later).

Tip: Circuit provides some helpful methods like `Circuit.add(other)` as a shorthand for `Add(self, other)`. The method `Circuit.mul` is also useful shorthand for elementwise multiplication.

<details>
<summary>Hint: help me get started!</summary>

Let's start by computing the mean with an Einsum. The syntax is the same as yesterday: `mean = rc.Einsum.from_einsum_string("h->", input)` or `rc.Einsum.from_fancy_string("hidden -> ", input)`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I have a weird Scalar 0.000099930048965724 in my Circuit and I can't figure out why!</summary>

This value is equal to `1/HIDDEN` and it probably means you accessed the input shape directly when building the Circuit. You have to use `rc.last_dim_size` to delay evaluation until after real shapes have been substituted for the symbolic shapes. This is a subtle point - ask a TA if this isn't clear!

## Substitutions and rc.Expander

Above, we didn't have to specify the shape of `ln` - it was automatically inferred to be `(HIDDEN,)` via the normal rules you implemented yesterday.

If we try to call `ln.evaluate()`, we'll see an error about it not being explicitly computable. This is telling us that we have `Symbol` instances remaining somewhere in the tree.

We could use an `Updater` like in Day 1 to replace the `Symbol`s with `Array`, but then we'd have to update our `Einsum` again, and we'd need a separate `Updater` for each thing we want to replace.

`rc.Expander` is a class that does all the updates in one shot and also takes care of the batching. Here's how to use it. (If your output doesn't match the reference output, continue reading for troubleshooting tips).

## Circuit Diffing

`print(rc.diff_circuits(circuit1, circuit2))` can take two `Circuit`s and render a colored diff between them. The problem of generating a minimal diff between two arbitrary trees is actually quite hard, and at the time of this writing this function isn't particularly smart. 

If your `layernorm` didn't produce the right output, diff it now against the version produced by `remix_d2_utils.working_layernorm` and see if this helps. Play with some of the keyword arguments to `diff_circuits`. This may or may not be actually helpful, and is mainly to emphasize that doing diffs is a thing you should consider when debugging.

## Printing and Serialization

If you just do `print(circuit)` or `repr(circuit)`, this renders a small representation which is limited in depth.

`circuit.print()` however, is a completely different beast. This takes (or constructs) a `rc.PrintOptions` instance which has a ton of arguments you can fiddle with to customize your printing. Generally, you'll want to create your own `PrintOptions` instance which is set up the way you like, and call `printer.print(circuit)` or `printer.repr(circuit)` on that.

The most important argument to `PrintOptions` is `bijection`, which causes your printout to be a complete representation of the circuit (with some caveats like custom GeneralFunctions). When `bijection=True`, you can convert the string representation back into an equivalent tree with `rc.Parser`.
"""
# %%

printer = rc.PrintOptions(bijection=True)

# %%
"""
## Tensor Storage

Serialization requires a way to serialize any tensors inside the circuit, such as model weights. Storing the tensors directly in the text representation would be very inefficient, so instead we hash the contents of the tensor and store the tensor on a disk in binary format at a path derived from their hash.

Importantly, when `bijection=True` this happens automatically, so unlike `print(circuit)` which is cheap and has no side effects, `circuit.print()` might write a lot of data to disk if you have large tensors.

By default, a series of nested folders on your local disk will be used for storage. For example, if a tensor's hash is `4f2fb80a7d72349dd5353e32c67a921368d6ab8eec58590a0c09b62492000be9`, then by default a file is created in `~/tensors_by_hash_cache/4f2f/b80a/` with the remainder of the hash as the filename.

Exercise: Check the hash of `rand1` below using `Array.tensor_hash_base16()`. Print out the circuit `total`, and then check your local filesystem to find the file that was created during printing. Verify that the file is roughly the size you expect, and that the tensor is only stored once (even though there are two references to it).

## Redwood Research File System (RRFS)

Redwood Research File System (RRFS) is just a big network filesystem managed by AWS where we store things that are too big for version control, such as model weights or datasets for experiments. If you type `ls ~/rrfs` in a terminal, you can check if you have this filesystem mounted on your machine.

If you upload your tensors to RRFS using `sync_tensors=True`, other users can automatically download them as needed over the network. Code for this is included in the `rc.Parser`, so the whole process is transparent - if you parse a `Circuit` and don't have the referenced `Tensor`s on their local machine, the library will automatically copy them over the network.

Use caution when `sync_tensors=True` to avoid using up excessive network bandwidth and disk space on tensors you don't actually care about (like the random tensor above).

If you find yourself creating lots of large temporary tensors, you may want to use `bijection=False` to avoid filling up your local disk.

For today, you won't have to upload any tensors and we'll only be downloading the pretrained weights via this mechanism.

## Circuit Simplification

In the PyTorch version, we needed to specify a flag for `elementwise_affine` and then we had to check this in the forward pass to avoid unnecessary computation. In Circuits, if we didn't want to have a bias in our layer norm, we can just substitute a `Scalar` with the appropriate shape and the value zero. While this won't use much memory (remember, `Scalar` is a view into a 1-element `Tensor`), this will still cause PyTorch to perform an unnecessary addition operation. We can detect and optimize this out with a rewrite.

Exercise: implement `add_elim_zeros`, then replace the bias node in `ln` with a zero `Scalar` and call `add_elim_zeros`. Check the diff and verify that the bias node was completely removed.

<details>

## "Batchable" Symbols

In GPT, our LayerNorm would run independently at each position of the sequence and independently on each batch element. In other words, the input would actually `(BATCH, SEQ, HIDDEN)` shape, not `(HIDDEN,)` as in our input `Symbol`.

In fact, we could keep adding more leading dimensions to the `(HIDDEN,)` shape, and LayerNorm would work properly until we hit some internal library limitation.

When you can safely replace a `Symbol` with an object that has more leading dimensions but is otherwise compatible, we say that symbol is "batchable".

Exercise: Make a new random `Tensor` that has batch and sequence dimensions and pass it into `Expander`. Print the result and verify that the new `Einsum`s look like what you'd expect. How many leading dimensions can you add? What breaks first once you add too many?

## Intro to Modules

Our LayerNorm has quite a few nodes representing low-level operations, and often we just want to view and work with it as "yeah, that's a box containing a standard LayerNorm" and not care about the specifics unless we specifically need to "open the box" and do rewrites that affect the internals.

In Circuits, we'll use the class `rc.ModuleSpec` to represent the concept of a "standard LayerNorm". All the LayerNorms in our transformer will share one instance of this. Inside the `ModuleSpec`, we have a Circuit with Symbol instances as placeholders - this is called the "spec circuit" or just "spec" for short. The output of our function `layernorm` above is already the appropriate thing.

The `ModuleSpec` also contains a `rc.ModuleArgSpec` instance, one for each unique `Symbol` in the spec circuit. This `ModuleArgSpec` stores information needed for batching.

Below we've written `LN_SPEC` in caps to emphasize that this is an immutable constant throughout our transformer. Note that a `ModuleSpec` is not itself a Circuit and thus can't directly appear in a tree.

<details>

<summary>I feel confused about which `Symbol`s should be batchable.</summary>

The only reason to make something not batchable is to get a helpful error if we mess up and try to pass in an input of the wrong shape. In our case, we already specialized our Circuit to only work when normalizing the last dimension, so it wouldn't make sense to have a weight or bias of more than 1D. On the other hand, in the real transformer we will have an input shape of `(batch, seq, hidden)` where the first two dimensions are treated as batch dimensions.

### Module instances

Each time in our computation tree that a standard LayerNorm appears, we will have a `rc.Module` instance representing "a box containing a standard LayerNorm with these specific weights and these specific inputs." 

In other words, if the `ModuleSpec` is like a function with argument names and a body, the `Module` instance is like a function call site where specific values are supplied for the arguments. 

`Module` has a method `substitute()` which will use the same underlying logic as `Expander` to substitute the arguments for the placeholders. Importantly, this happens by name and not using `Matcher`, so it's necessary that within the `ModuleSpec` all distinct `Symbol`s have unique names. The result of substitution is a regular node, `Add` in this case.

When you `evaluate()` a `Module`, it just does `substitute` to replace itself with a regular node, and then calls `evaluate` on the regular node.

To reiterate: each place in the graph where a LayerNorm is used will be a different `Module` instance because the inputs are different, but all the `Module` instances will share the same `ModuleSpec`.

Below we show how to make a `Module` version of LayerNorm. After this, you'll do the MLP and Attention `Module` implementations on your own.

Exercise: Run the cell and check out the notation in the printed `Module`. Note that the "!" means that when we evaluate the `Module`, all occurrences of the name on the right are replaced with the value on the left.

The first letter of "ftt" means that the first flag (batchable) is `False`; the remaining letters mean that the other two flags (which we'll completely ignore today) are `True`.

Exercise: Why do we need to unpack the dictionary literal with `**` below?

<details>

<summary>Solution - Dictionary Unpacking</summary>

It's because the symbol names have a period in them, which makes them not valid Python identifiers. If the name was "ln_input" instead then we could just pass `ln_input=Array(actual_input)` without requiring unpacking.

### ModuleSpec Sanity Checks

It's always a good idea to do sanity checks when you're writing specs. Two things that should be true are:

- Each of your `Symbol`s needs a unique name. This is like checking a function for two arguments with the same name - if this happened the library wouldn't know which one to substitute into the body.

We will be writing a `Module` for the attention layer, but often we want to "open the box" on this one and interact with the internals. We need a convenient way to get rid of the `Module` and just have regular nodes that we can do regular rewrites on.

In the analogy where a `Module` node represents a function call, we want to "inline" the call and not have a function call at all but instead substitute the body of the function with all the arguments replaced.

Recall that when we `evaluate` a `Module`, it just calls its own `substitute` method to turn into a regular node. We can just call `substitute` ourselves to do the inlining! This new form is extensionally equal.

## MLP Module

Exercise: implement a `Module` version of the MLP in GPT-2. Again, ignore the flags besides `batchable`.

Note that the input to the MLP `Module` should be declared as shape `(HIDDEN,)`. Just like the LayerNorm, this reminds us that the MLP does the same operation at every sequence position. When we use this in the full transformer, since the MLP input is `batchable` then `Expander` will take care of the leading batch and sequence dimensions for us.

## Computing the Attention Mask

Before we can do the attention module, we need to compute our attention mask.

- In an autoregressive transformer, we need a tensor of shape `(seq_q, seq_k)` which has `causal_mask[q][k] = 0 if k > q`. For speed, this tensor can be allocated once and shared between all the attention heads in the network. I'll call this the "causal mask".

- When we actually mask the attention scores, we have a tensor of shape `(batch, seq_q, seq_k)` with 0 for valid (this is the opposite of the meaning of 0 previously) and -10000 for invalid. This doesn't have a standard name, and I'll call this the "additive attention mask" because you add it to the attention scores. You'll need to compute this in `apply_attention_mask` soon.

While it's possible to write a custom `GeneralFunction` for this, it's tidier to use the basic classes whenever possible to avoid problems with serialization.

You can do this using `Einsum`, `Scalar`, and `Add` by first multiplying invalid positions by 0, then adding -10000.0.

The multiply by zero is not strictly necessary. Even if the attention score was pretty large to begin with, after subtracting -10000 and exponentiating the result should be basically zero (or identically zero depending on the floating point precision).

If you feel stuck, look at w2d1_solution.py for some more guidance or call a TA - don't spend a lot of time stuck here.
